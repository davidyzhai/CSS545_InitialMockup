Brief Description

The target audience of this app is the demographic that travels the most, which is between 23-38 years old. This demographic is of interest because they are likely to have a willingness to spend on travel and dining experiences compared to other demographics. There are a few ways the design of our app will be relevant to the target demographic. Firstly, this age group values efficiency and convenience in their digital experiences. Our design is streamlined, and the recommendation process is swift; providing fast solutions that retain simplicity. The design furthermore focuses on personalization and visual appeal, which are two factors appreciated by this age range which improves the user experience. 

Happy Path

The happy path is outlined in our design by the arrows. In one instance, the app is loaded. The user is prompted to enter some screening details to figure out their culinary and travel preferences (profile setup). They then have the option to click a button that will recommend them somewhere to go. Upon clicking this button, the details of the recommendation will be shown on a new screen, and a “take me” or “try again” button will appear. The user will click take me and be given directions to the location. Another happy path would be if the user had already given preferences (which we would save) and therefore follow the same layout while skipping the screening details page. 

Success Criteria
One way we are showing success criteria in the mockup is after the user gets directions to their recommendation, we calculate the average time they saved by getting a recommendation from the app. This will be shown on the same screen as the directions to the recommendation, and is calculated by subtracting their time spent from 20 minutes (the average time taken to choose a place to eat/go).
